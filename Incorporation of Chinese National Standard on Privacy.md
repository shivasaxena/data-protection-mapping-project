# Note regarding the incorporation of National Standard of People's Republic of China GB/T35273-2020 into the Data Protection Mapping Project

Publicly launched on GitHub in Feb 2020, the open-source Data Protection Mapping Project is designed to facilitate global privacy community collaboration and consensus building in order to identify in detail the relationship between ISO/IEC 27701 (Extension to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for privacy information management) and various privacy regulatory requirements. By establishing a consensus on the mapping between ISO/IEC 27701 and different privacy regulatory requirements, the project seeks to help implementers of ISO/IEC 27701 achieve regulatory compliance more efficiently and effectively. To that end, several privacy requirements as articulated by regulations, such as European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and California's Consumer Privacy Act, have been mapped in the project tool. These mappings were vetted by independent data curators and reviewed by the global privacy community at large. As with any open-source projects, corrections and updates can be proposed by the community to help improve the accuracy of the mappings.

The Data Protection Mapping Project is pleased to add GB/T35273, the National Standard of Republic of China for personal information security, to its collection of mappings. The mapping was initially proposed by Maggie Meng from Global Law Office, subsequently vetted and revised by the project data curators, and again reviewed by Maggie Meng prior to publication. Similar to other mappings, the mapping is meant to be a tool of consensus building among privacy professionals and is subject to further reviews and updates from the global community. The project data curators are not privacy experts with specialized knowledge in terms of the Chinese context. Reviews and revisions from the Chinese authorities and Chinese privacy community are encouraged.

The project fully recognizes and notes that GB/T35273 is published by the People's Republic of China's State Administration for Market Regulation. For this standard (and for each of the standards and regulations included in the mapping project), only those portions of the standard that are directly mapped to ISO/IEC 27701 are shown on the mapping tool. The full GB/T35273 standard is distributed at no cost in [English](https://www.tc260.org.cn/front/postDetail.html?id=20200918200432) by TC260, the authoring committee of GB/T35273. The [Chinese text version](https://www.tc260.org.cn/advice/detail.html?norm_id=20190104153824&amp;norm_iso_id=GB/T%2035273%E2%80%942020) is also published by the State Administration for Market Regulation. All users are advised to consult the original text as the authoritative version in order to gain full comprehension of the standard.

2020 年2 月在GitHub 上公开推出的开源数据保护映射项目旨在促进和构建全球隐私社区协作和共识，以便详细分析ISO/IEC 27701（ISO/IEC 27001 扩展和ISO/IEC 27002 隐私信息管理）与各种隐私监管要求之间的关系。通过就ISO/IEC 27701 与不同隐私法规、标准要求之间的映射达成共识，该项目旨在帮助ISO/IEC 27701 实施者更高效地实现法规合规性。为此，项目工具中已经绘制了一些法规所阐明的隐私要求，如欧盟一般数据保护条例和加利福尼亚州的消费者隐私法。这些映射关系由独立数据负责人审查，并经全球隐私界审查。与任何开源项目一样，社区可以提出更正和更新，以帮助提高映射的准确性。

数据保护映射项目很高兴在其集合中添加 GB/T35273，即中华人民共和国的个人信息安全国家规范。映射关系最初由环球律师事务所的孟洁提出，随后由项目数据负责人审查和修订，并在发布前再次由孟洁审查。 与其他映射关系类似，该映射项目旨在成为隐私专业人员之间建立共识的工具，并受到国际社会的进一步审查和更新。项目数据负责人不是具有中国背景专业知识的隐私专家，数据保护映射项目鼓励中国当局和中国隐私社区的审查和修订。

该项目充分肯定并注意到GB/T35273由中华人民共和国市场监管总局发布。对于此标准（以及映射项目中包含的每个标准和法规），映射工具上仅显示直接映射到 ISO/IEC 27701 的标准部分。完整的GB/T35273标准由GB/T35273的编写委员会TC260免费以[英文](https://www.tc260.org.cn/front/postDetail.html?id=20200918200432)分发。 [中文本](https://www.tc260.org.cn/advice/detail.html?norm_id=20190104153824&amp;norm_iso_id=GB/T%2035273%E2%80%942020)由国家市场监督管理总局发布。建议所有用户参考原文作为权威版本，以便充分理解标准。
